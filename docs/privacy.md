# Privacy policy

minRender is a render-farm manager that runs on machines you own, on your
own network. It is built so that nothing about you or your work leaves that
network.

## What the app does with data

- **No accounts, no sign-in, no telemetry.** The app never contacts us and
  has no analytics, crash reporting, or usage tracking of any kind.
- **Job data stays on your network.** Job names, file paths, render logs,
  and node information are written to the shared folder you choose and to
  each machine's local application data. They are exchanged only between
  your own render nodes over your LAN or VPN.
- **Network use.** Nodes talk to each other over HTTP on a port you
  configure and discover each other with local multicast. Those connections
  are confined to your network.
- **Update check.** The direct-download build checks a file on our website
  for new versions and downloads an installer when you ask it to. That
  request carries no personal information. The Microsoft Store build does
  not do this; the Store handles updates.
- **Render applications.** minRender launches the render software you have
  installed (Blender, After Effects, Cinema 4D). Their own network behaviour
  and privacy terms are theirs, not ours.

## Data we hold

None. We operate no servers that receive data from the app.
